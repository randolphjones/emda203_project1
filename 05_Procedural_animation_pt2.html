<!-- 
In this module, we'll be using tweens. You may have heard the term used in Flash before. Now we'll be tweening with code. This is a technique you can get by without using however, when you learn it, it will make production (and your life) much simpler.

Tweening with code allows us to apply a transformation over a set period of time. Tweens are very powerful in that they can be chained together and can easily be modified to affect a wide range of properties (not just transformations).

	var myStage;
	var eggManFrozen;


		function init(){
			myStage = new createjs.Stage(document.getElementById("myCanvas"));
			
			//Let's add a bitmap to our stage.
			//Do you notice anything new that we're doing her now?
			//Do you think that there can be an advantage to not using a fixed number to place display objects on the stage?
			eggManFrozen = new createjs.Bitmap("images/eggMan_freezeFrame.png");
			eggManFrozen.regX = 256/2;
			eggManFrozen.regY = 256/2;
			eggManFrozen.x=(document.getElementById("myCanvas").width)/2;
			eggManFrozen.y=(document.getElementById("myCanvas").height)/2;
			myStage.addChild(eggManFrozen);
			
			//Let's try something new. Here's how we create a tween.
			//As soon as we create this tween it's going to play.
			//Tween statements are a little more complex than some of the other things we do but there's good reason for this. Tweens are very powerful and thereform there's a lot of specifications that go into a tween. So check out the tween below. It's an example of a "chained" tween. Not every tween you build will be this long but this shows how you can "chain" the tweens together so one action can follow another. I also show different transformation values being changed at different times. 
			//In the .get portion of this command we specify the display object we want to tween. Oddly enough this is also where we set our preference for looping. 
			//In the .to portion of this command, we specify properties of that display object that we want to change along with what we want to change that value to. After that we specify how long (in milliseconds) we want the transition (tween) to take. Finally, we can add an additional argument to the .to command to specify EASING. Easing is just another way that one value is changed to another. Normally, the change is divided evenly over time, however, if you EASE the change with a preset algorithm, it can have some different effects. 
			//The .wait portion of this command specifies how long to WAIT before the next change or action takes place (in milliseconds).
			//Finally, you can use an additional statement called .call. You won't see this here because I want you to research this on your own. 
			//.call is very important because it gives you the ability to CALL a specific function once the tween is complete. For example, once our character is done tweening, we can call a special function to display a message "All done"
			createjs.Tween.get(eggManFrozen, {loop:true})
				.to({x:500},1000, createjs.Ease.easeIn)
				.wait(500)
				.to({scaleX:1.3, scaleY:1.3, rotation:60},500, createjs.Ease.bounceOut)
				.wait(250)
				.to({y:100, alpha:0},250, createjs.Ease.bounceIn)
				.wait(100)
				.to({x:500, rotation:0, alpha:1},1000, createjs.Ease.easeOut)
				.wait(500)
				.to({y:300, scaleX:1, scaleY:1}, 100, createjs.Ease.easeIn)
				.wait(100)
				.to({x:(document.getElementById("myCanvas").width)/2},1000, createjs.Ease.easeOut)
				.wait(500)
				.to({y:(document.getElementById("myCanvas").height)/2}, 100, createjs.Ease.easeIn);

			//Experiment with this extensively to see the results. Change some of the properties, remove some things from the chain and add new pieces to the chain.
			
			
			createjs.Ticker.setFPS(12);
			createjs.Ticker.addEventListener("tick", drawNewFrame);
		}
		

		
		function drawNewFrame(evt){
			myStage.update();
		}
		
		//Congratulations! You now understand programmatic tweening.
		//Here's some questions:
		//Do tweens only apply to transformation values or can they apply to other properties as well (transparency for example)? Did you notice any instances where it applies to a property that was NOT a transformation (move, rotate, scale)?
		//Do tweens constantly need to be fed by fixed values? What do you do if the endpoint of your tween is not always certain? 
		//How do you think you could pass a tween values that are created from user interaction (mouse clicks, etc)?
		//Finally, what kind of things do you think you can do with .call that could build your user experience?
