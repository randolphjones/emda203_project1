<!-- 
In this module, we'll be adding procedural animation to a display object. In this first part we'll cover incrementing motion.

Procedural animation is transformation over time using code.

	var myStage;
	
	//We will need to use our display object ACROSS MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS
	//In order to do this, we need to declare the object's variable OUTSIDE of any functions.
	var eggManFrozen;

		function init(){
			myStage = new createjs.Stage(document.getElementById("myCanvas"));
			
			//Let's populate that global variable now with an image, move it into the middle of our stage, and then add it to the stage
			eggManFrozen = new createjs.Bitmap("images/eggMan_freezeFrame.png");
			eggManFrozen.x=320;
			eggManFrozen.y=180;
			eggManFrozen.regX = 128;
			eggManFrozen.regY = 128;
			myStage.addChild(eggManFrozen);
			
			//Nothing changes with our ticker since the last module
			createjs.Ticker.setFPS(12);
			createjs.Ticker.addEventListener("tick", drawNewFrame);
		}
		
		//We're going to add some new lines of code to our frame drawing function
		function drawNewFrame(evt){
			
			//For each frame let's increment the rotation of our display object.
			//Modify this value to see what the effect is.
			//Since we're doing this each frame, what do you think the result will be?
			eggManFrozen.rotation += 3;
			
			//now we use the same old update command to show the change in movement
			myStage.update();
		}
		
		//Congratulations! You now know the very baseline concept of procedural animation.
		//What do you think would happen if we incremented other transform properties? Translation? Scale?
		//What do you think we'll need to do if we want the display object to look like it's rotating from the center? 
		//How do you think we can adjust the display object's pivot point?
		//Here's a hint: http://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/Bitmap.html#property_regX
		//Now modify this example so our object rotates around it's center.
		//Do you think the pivot point of a display object is important to consider for more than just rotation? What's its effect on other transformations?
