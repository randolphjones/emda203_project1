<!-- 
In this module, we'll be transforming an image (display object). Basic transformation involves translating (moving), rotating, and scaling.

We're going to add an image to the stage and then apply a few transformations to this. It's very important to know this because it's the baseline for procedural animation.

Everything that's not commented is explained in the previous module so if any of this is confusing go back and read that one first.

	var myStage;
	var myHat;
	function init(){
		myStage = new createjs.Stage(document.getElementById("myCanvas"));
		
		//This should look familiar. This is how we create a new bitmap object, right?
		//Let's add a graphic of a hat
		myHat = new createjs.Bitmap("images/hat.png");
		
		//Now that the hat is an object in our app, we can apply all kinds of transformations to it to properly place it.
		//Here's a quick tip. Bitmaps are a smaller subset of what are known as DISPLAY OBJECTS.
		//Display Objects are typically subject to these same manipulations
		
		//Let's translate or move the HAT. We do this by setting the X and Y coordinate for the hat
		myHat.x = 320;
		myHat.y = 180;
		
		//Let's rotate our hat some by setting it's rotation property to the number of degrees we want.
		myHat.rotation=45;
		
		//Now let's use the scaleX and scaleY properties to set the size of our object.
		myHat.scaleX=.6;
		myHat.scaleY=.6;
		
		//Now change the properties above to new numbers. Reload this file in your web browser to see how the image changes.
		//What happens when these values are set to 0?
		//What happens when these values are set to 1?
		//Try various combinations to see what happens.
		
		myStage.addChild(myHat);
		
		
		createjs.Ticker.addEventListener('tick', drawNewFrame);
		createjs.Ticker.setFPS(12);
		
	}

	function drawNewFrame(evt){
		myStage.update();
	}

			
		// Congrats! You're now the master of display object manipulation.
		// If we had a way to change these transformations a little bit each time a frame is counted then what do you think we'll get?
		// Do you think we could use read the transform properties of another display object, change those properties, and then apply them to a different display object? What effect do you think this would create for us?
